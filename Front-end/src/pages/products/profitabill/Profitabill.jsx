              hence built a comprehensive dashboard that gives <br />
              useful insights for the business owners. Reports <br />
              include best selling services by gender, heat map of <br />

              We noticed that businesses often rely on external <br />
              marketing softwares even for simple needs. <br />
              Hence we went ahead and built a marketing engine <br />
              that is contextual. Businesses can target customer <br />
              segments like Active Customers, Inactive Customers etc. <br />
              This greatly improves campaign success and <br />
              it all happens in just 3 steps.
